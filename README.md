# Introduction

This repository serves as a Proof of Concept (POC) for creating a custom Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on AWS. It leverages Terraform for infrastructure provisioning, OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication, and GitHub Actions for seamless CI/CD integration.

# Appendix

## Generate an EIP Policy

To assign an Elastic IP (EIP) to a NAT Gateway, you must create a custom IAM policy with the necessary permissions. This policy ensures that the required actions can be performed securely and effectively.

## Amazon Policy

For this workshop, we will use the **AmazonVPCFullAccess** policy to manage VPC resources while ensuring the roleâ€™s access within AWS is appropriately scoped and limited.
